# Barista Bot

Personal discord bot developed in Python. Does a lot of stuff! Like:
- Plays audio to the voice channel the requester is in.

    Depending on the arguments and the state of the player, it resumes, starts playing a song, or adds a song to the end or start of the current playlist.

        /play [youtube-link] [order-to-add-to-playlist]


    Examples:

    `/play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5VJnxDLaZY`

    `/play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5VJnxDLaZY next`

    `/play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5VJnxDLaZY last`

    `/play`

- Pauses audio.

        /pause

- Skips the current song.

        /skip

- Stops audio and clears the current paylist:

        /stop
